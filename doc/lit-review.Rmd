This seminal (200+ citations) tests shifts in demographic and socioeconomic variables for UHC versus distance based methods. This appears to be a baseline approach for the SoVI study. Of key note are:

  1. They employ two approaches, one that is toxic site-wise (i.e., considering the toxic site as the centroid of the buffered neighborhood) and one that is census tract-wise (i.e., using the centroid of the census track as the bueffered neighborhood). They claim the second is more conservative but I don't fully understand why.
  2. The anonymous reviewers suggest an additional distance-based approach that might be worth considering in note #5 at bottom of page 396.
  3. They use logistic regression to test presence/lack of a contaminated site within census blocks as a function of demographic and socioeconomic variables. It seems a number of studies employ regression analysis to examine the factors here as well.
